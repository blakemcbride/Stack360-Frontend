### Docker Image

We also have the full system available as a docker image at
[https://hub.docker.com/r/blake1024/stack360](https://hub.docker.com/r/blake1024/stack360)

These images are convenient for a quick and easy way to get the system
up and running for evaluation purposes.  However, these images are not
intended to be of value for development or production use.  This repo
is for that.

### Documentation

A system manual for the Stack360 system which covers system architecture, acts as a developer guide,
and covers system configuration is being published on Amazon.com before April 15, 2024.
This repo will be populated on or soon after that date.
