# STACK360 Web-based Business Process Software

Comprehensive Business Process Software for Service-oriented Organizations.

****This repository contains a snapshot of the source code as it existed on May 7, 2024 (excluding customer-specific code).
A book detailing the system's internals has also been published on Amazon.
Since that date, the system has undergone many enhancements and is in production use on a daily basis.
However, due to lower-than-anticipated interest in the open-source code, a decision has been made, at least 
for the time being, not to update this repository.
Please feel free to contact me if you would like the latest version of the system or require support.**

We are pleased to introduce Stack360, our robust web-based business process software. 
Stack360 has been a trusted solution in production for over a decade, providing a suite of integrated functions 
specifically designed for service-oriented organizations. This comprehensive system optimizes various business 
operations, including:

* Applicant Tracking: Automate your recruitment process.
* Human Resources Management: Effectively manage your workforce.
* Project Management: Ensure your projects remain on schedule and within budget.
* Worker Time Tracking: Seamlessly integrate worker hours with payroll and client billing.
* Customer Relationship Management: Oversee sales prospects and client relationships.
* Client Invoicing: Optimize the client billing process.
* Employee Benefit Administration: Administer employee health benefits, insurance, time-off, and more.
* And much more...
