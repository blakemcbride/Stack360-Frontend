### Full System Documentation

Through [Amazon](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1245Q1F), we published the "Stack360
System Manual".  This manual documents the architecture of the system,
acts as a developer guide, and covers system configuration.

### Docker Image

We also have the full system available as a docker image at
[https://hub.docker.com/r/blake1024/stack360](https://hub.docker.com/r/blake1024/stack360)

These images are convenient for a quick and easy way to get the system
up and running for evaluation purposes.  However, these images are not
intended to be of value for development or production use.  This repo
is for that.
